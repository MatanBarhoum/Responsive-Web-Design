<br>
In this project I learned about typography, how to arrange and sort classes and display them properly. 
<br>
There are 2 classes for the percentage which are bold and right. The right class is about floating the text to the right, and bold is about font-weighting. 
<br>
there's 3 dividers, a regular divider, a "medium" md divider and a "large" lg divider. all of them usign the bottom-border to make a line to seperate between "rows" and to display the data correctly.
